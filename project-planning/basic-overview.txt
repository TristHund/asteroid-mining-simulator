This project will need to contain several different modules.
It will consist of a front end I was thinking which could be done in svelte/js or ts; could also be done with react but I personally like svelte better.

The backend I am thinking will be easiest to set up with python and perhaps using Cython for some performance gains. We can use flask to build out the API layer.

The modules needed will be the following:

Satelite Construction Module

Launch and Orbit Selection Module

Trajectory Planning Module

Approach and Landing Module

Mining Dynamics Module

Refinement Process Module

Return To Earth Module
